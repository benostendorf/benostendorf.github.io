 abstract = {Staphylococcus intermedius is known primarily for its role as a commensal and pathogen in dogs and a variety of other animals. It has also been reported as a cause of human infection in a limited number of cases. Here, we report a case of S. intermedius wound infection in a 47-year-old woman with postradiation skin changes. Transmission occurred most likely through direct skin contact with her pet dog. This case highlights the possibility of pet-transmitted infections in predisposed patients and should raise awareness of possibly drug-resistant pathogens in animal reservoirs.},
